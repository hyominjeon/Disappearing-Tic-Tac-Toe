# Disappearing Tic Tac Toe

Disappearing Tic Tac Toe is a variation of regular Tic Tac Toe.  The rules are the following:
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Each of the nine squares in the grid is colored white initially.
- The two players are called red and blue.
- The players alternate making moves.
- Red moves first.
- Players select a white square and mark it with their color.
- After there are three squares of each color on the board, when a player makes a move, the square that was least recently marked by the player reverts to white.
- A player wins by having three squares on the same row, column, or diagonal marked with the player's color.

The game should:
- have a grid of nine squares colored appropriately,
- allow players to make legal moves by clicking on the game grid,
- prevent players from making any illegal moves,
- report when a player has won, and
- have a way to start a new game at any point.
