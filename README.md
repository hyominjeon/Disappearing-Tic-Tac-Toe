# DisappearingTicTacToe

Disappearing Tic Tac Toe is based on regular Tic Tac Toe. Here are the rules:
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Initially each of the nine squares in the grid is colored white.
- The two players are called red and blue. The players alternate making moves, with red moving first.
- Until there are three squares of each color on the board, red (blue) selects a white square and marks it with
red (blue).
- After there are three squares of each color on the board, red (blue) selects a white square and marks it with red (blue). As soon as this happens, the square that was least recently marked red (blue) reverts to white.
- The game continues in this fashion, with the players alternating moves, until red (blue) wins by having the
three red (blue) squares on the same row, column, or diagonal.

At a minimum, your game should:
- have a game grid consisting of nine squares colored white, red, and blue as appropriate,
- allow the players to make legal moves by clicking on the game grid,
- prevent players from making illegal moves,
- report when a player has won, and
- have a way to start a new game at any point.
